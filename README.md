# MNIST Sign Language
Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist (*~18k datapoints*)

This is my approach to the MNIST Sign Language dataset using Convolutional Nerual Networks.


Deep Learning Library - Keras (TensorFlow Backend)

Feel free to change activation functions, batch size, epochs etc.

If you get a better result let me know! :D
